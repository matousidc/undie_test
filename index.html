                        <h2>About</h2>
                        <p>Welcome to my portfolio! My name is Tereza Marková, but in the creative world, I craft under
                            the name <em>Undie</em>. While my professional journey began in the structured world of corporate
                            finance, I always felt a yearning for something more tangible—something that allowed me to
                            work with my hands and bring ideas to life in the real world. So, in 2023, I took the leap to
                            reconnect with my passion for craftsmanship, and that's how Undie was born.<br>
                            It all started with a single design: the Biggie Bag. From the beginning, my focus has been on
                            creating unisex designs that resonate with an outdoor spirit—because that’s a reflection of who I
                            am. I love versatility and multifunctionality, and I strive to weave those values into every piece I
                            create. My designs aren’t just accessories; they’re tools meant to adapt to your lifestyle and
                            stand the test of time.<br>
                            I primarily work with durable, high-quality outdoor materials sourced from local suppliers, but
                            sustainability is a cornerstone of what I do. That’s why I also incorporate secondhand and
                            deadstock fabrics wherever possible, giving new life to materials that might otherwise go
                            unused. Every bag is thoughtfully designed and lovingly handcrafted by me, with an emphasis
                            on quality and individuality. While my core designs are customizable to suit your needs, I’m
                            always excited to collaborate on fully custom creations from scratch—those projects ignite my
                            creativity the most.<br>
                            At Undie, I believe in a philosophy of repair and sustainability. Instead of replacing your
                            belongings when they wear out, why not fix them? If your Undie bag ever needs a little bit of
                            love, just let me know, and I’ll be happy to repair it for you. It’s my small way of encouraging a
                            world that values durability, mindfulness, and conscious consumption.<br>
                            Thank you for stopping by—let’s create something meaningful together!</p>

                            <h3>Biggie</h3>
                            <div class="product-image biggie-image-main"></div>
                            <div class="product-image biggie-image-small-1"></div>
                            <div class="product-image biggie-image-small-2"></div>
                            <p>Biggie - Also known as the design my friends wouldn’t let me keep to myself, this bag holds a
                                special place in my journey—it’s where it all began. The inspiration struck during a frustratingly
                                familiar moment: a quick trip to the grocery store, only to realize I’d forgotten my trusty tote bag.
                                With nothing to carry my groceries in, the idea for a smarter, more versatile bag was born. I
                                wanted something that wasn’t just functional but seamlessly fit into everyday life—perfect for
                                city strolls with a spontaneous stop at the market.<br>
                                And so, the Expansible Bag came to life. Designed to adapt to your needs, this bag expands
                                both horizontally and vertically, offering flexibility for whatever your day holds. Whether you’re
                                carrying a few essentials or loading up with fresh produce, it adjusts effortlessly. The secure zip
                                closure keeps everything safe, while a handy interior pocket provides the perfect spot for your
                                smaller must-haves—keys, wallet, or phone. The adjustable straps ensure a comfortable fit,
                                tailored just for you, no matter your height or how you prefer to wear it.<br>
                                It’s more than just a bag—it’s a problem solver, a daily companion, and a reflection of my love
                                for thoughtful, functional design.</p>

                            <p>With this design, I wanted to bring my favorite creative technique to life—a unique, stretchy
                                thread style I call freestyle. It’s an organic process that adds texture and personality to every
                                piece, making each bag one-of-a-kind. No two are exactly the same, and that’s what I love most
                                about it—the individuality stitched into every thread.<br>
                                Versatility is at the heart of this bag. Thanks to its adjustable straps, you can wear it in whatever
                                way suits your vibe or needs: as a fun and functional fanny pack, a stylish crossbody, or
                                effortlessly slung over your shoulder. The original design features a sleek magnetic closure for
                                easy access, but if you prefer something more secure, I can swap it out for a
                                zipper—customization is always an option.<br>
                                What’s more, the size is completely up to you! Whether you need something compact for your
                                essentials or a roomier version to fit your on-the-go lifestyle, we can tailor it to fit your world. It’s
                                a bag that’s as flexible and unique as you are, blending style, function, and just the right touch
                                of individuality.</p>

                                allowing you to create a bag that reflects your personal style. The magnetic closure is a
